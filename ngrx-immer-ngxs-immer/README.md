Playground to use [Immer][immer] with [NgRx][ngrx] or [NGXS][ngxs].

Used as example in the following posts:

* ["Clean NgRx reducers using Immer"][ngrx-medium].
* ["Simple state mutations in NGXS with Immer"][ngxs-medium].

You can take a look at the other implementations by switching branches:

* use the `ngrx` branch for the 'default' NgRx implementation.
* use the `ngrx-immer` branch for the Immer NgRx implementation.
* use the `ngxs` branch for the 'default' NGXS implementation.
* use the `ngxs-immer` branch for the Immer NGXS implementation.
